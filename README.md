# CS3200 - Organization of Programming Languages

Course Description - 
A hands-on introduction to the science of programming and programming languages, including topics such as: 
structured data and pattern-matching, recursive and polymorphic data, recursion and higher-order functions, 
lazy evaluation and streams, automated and equational reasoning about programs, concrete and abstract syntax, grammars, interpreters, 
desugaring, types and type-checking, type safety, mutable state, references, and objects. Over the course of the semester, 
students build interpreters and type checkers for a series of increasingly complex languages.

In this class we explored the nuances of implementing a programming language through a language called Pyret, which is a functional language based on Python.

The class culminated with PA6, where we implemented a toy language with basic arithmetic, functions, and recursion, with a desugarer and type-checker.
